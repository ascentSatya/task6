## File Structure

```
contact-form/
 ├── index.html       # Main HTML file
 ├── style.css        # Styling and animations
 ├── script.js        # Form validation and interactivity
 └── imagebg.jpeg     # Background image for cinematic look
```

---

## How It Works

1. The form checks for **empty inputs** and **valid email format** using a regex.
2. If invalid, the container shakes and displays **error messages**.
3. If all inputs are valid, a **success message** appears and the form resets.
4. All validation is **client-side**, no backend required.

---

## Customization

* Replace `imagebg.jpeg` with your preferred background.
* Update the **button color** or **accent color** in `style.css`.
* Modify fonts or sizes using Google Fonts or CSS variables.
